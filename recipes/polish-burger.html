      This recipe is a family favorite that was passed down over the
      generations. Grandma and Pap just ate them plain, with a fork (sometimes
      dipped in ketchup), but our family likes to top these burgers with cheese
      and serve on a hamburger bun in a the traditional way. I have also seen
      these referred to as Kotlety Mielone. These can also be cooked on the
      grill.
